# ONNX Runtime Custom Op Minimal Example

This project demonstrates how to create a minimal custom operator for ONNX Runtime. The custom operator is implemented in C++ and integrated with ONNX Runtime to extend its functionality.

## Prerequisites

- ONNX Runtime
- C++ Compiler
- CMake

## Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onnxruntime_custom_op_minimal_example.git
    cd onnxruntime_custom_op_minimal_example
    ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Configure the project using CMake:
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```

4. Build the project:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

## Running the Example

After building the project, you can register the generated lib_custom_op library using onnxruntime.
